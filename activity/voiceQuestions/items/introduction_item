Please do not use the Mumble Melody app for these tasks.<br><br>We will be asking you a set of open questions. After you are asked a question, record your voice using the Record feature. You will see a countdown and are required to speak for the ENTIRE time of the countdown. For some questions, if you do not find the question inspiring, you will have the option to Skip and we will give you another question. Please be aware that researchers will be reviewing these recordings. You will not be able to re-record your submission.
