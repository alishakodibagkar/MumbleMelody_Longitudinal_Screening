  <h2>Welcome to the Participation Screening Session for the Mumble Melody Longitudinal Study on Stuttering</h2>
  <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this study. We are researchers from MIT working to expand research on audio-based approaches that may help increase fluency for adults who stutter.

    <h3>Background Information</h3>
    <p>Stuttering affects ~1% of the population worldwide. This condition is characterized by involuntary repetitions, blockages, and prolongations of sound during speaking. Studies have found that fluency can be increased for PWS using altered auditory feedback or AAF. Common AAF methods that have been found include playing back one’s own voice fractions of a second after it is spoken - this is known as “delayed auditory feedback” - and altering the pitch of one’s own voice to sound lower or higher - this is known as “frequency shifted auditory feedback”. There are commercially-available technologies that take advantage of these observations by continuously playing a recording into the ear. These systems, however, are expensive, often do not work long term, and cannot be easily personalized. We are interested in developing an approach that is more user-friendly and effective in the long term.

    <h3>About this Session</h3>
    <p>This initial screening session will determine if you are eligible to participate in this study. Here is how the session will take place today:<br>
<br>(1) First, we will ask you a few questions.
<br>(2) Next, we will ask you to do a volume check to ensure recording quality.
<br>(3) Next, we will establish your fluency baseline with a series of open questions and passage-reading tasks
<br><br>Please note that we will NOT be keeping recordings from this screening session and will be destroying them for your privacy after evaluating your eligibility.

    <h3>After This Session</h3>
    <p> After completing this screening, we will notify you in around 1 week of your eligibility to continue this study for around 28 days. Please refrain from using the Mumble Melody app until then. If you qualify to continue the study, we will be sending you information on how to participate. Those who qualify for weekly testing sessions can only qualify if their stuttering is at a moderate to severe level during the screening process, which means stutter-like disfluencies in more than 3% of total spoken syllables. This doesn’t have anything to do with YOUR identity as a person who stutters, whether the Mumble Melody app will be useful for you, or what situations you may stutter less or more than you did during the screening portion of the study. This only has to do with our screening procedure for the study. If you have downloaded or tried the Mumble Melody app and feel it has been beneficial to you, you are welcome to continue using the app until it expires.

    <h3>Ready to Get Started?</h3>
    <p>To begin, please make sure that you are sitting somewhere comfortable and quiet, where you feel like you can speak out loud and converse. During this session, you will be speaking into your device, and us researchers will be analyzing your submitted recordings. You may use the same iOS device that you indicated on your prior form for operating the Application, or a separate device that you would like to use to record your session. In either case, make sure you are using a device that you would like to use for future sessions. Additionally, make sure that your device is connected to either the internet or cellular data.<br><br> This screening session will be about 15 minutes long.
